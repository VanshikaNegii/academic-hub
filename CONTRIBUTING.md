# ü§ù Contributing Guide
Thank you for your interest in improving Academic Hub! Your help is valued ‚Äî whether you contribute code, documentation, designs, or ideas. This guide explains how to get started, what we expect from contributors, and how to make your first PR successful.

## üß≠ Quick overview
Fork the repo, create a branch, make small focused changes, and open a PR.

See GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md for bite-sized tasks.

Read our CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and follow it.

## üç¥ How to contribute (step-by-step)
1) Fork the repository
Click the Fork button in the top-right of the repository page.

2) Clone your fork
Bash

# HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/unkeett/academic-hub.git
cd academic-hub

# or SSH
git clone git@github.com:unkeett/academic-hub.git
cd academic-hub
3) Create a feature branch
Always create a branch for your work:

Bash

git checkout -b feat/short-description
# or
git checkout -b fix/short-description
4) Make changes and commit
Keep changes focused (one feature/fix per PR).

Follow the existing code style.

Use sensible commit messages (imperative tense):

Bash

git add .
git commit -m "feat(notes): add search functionality"
5) Test locally
Run the project locally to ensure nothing broke:

Bash
cd frontend
npm run start
cd backend
node server.js

6) Push your branch and open a PR
Bash

git push -u origin feat/short-description
Go to GitHub ‚Üí your fork ‚Üí Compare & pull request ‚Üí pick the upstream main as the base and write a clear description.

## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Backend Server

The backend is a Node.js/Express API that connects to MongoDB.

Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Install dependencies:

pnpm install      # or npm install

Create environment file: Create a new file named .env in the /backend directory. Add your secret keys as shown below. This file should not be committed to Git.

Code snippet

backend/.env.example

MONGO_URI=<yourmongodburl>
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY_HERE

Start the dev server:

node server.js

The API will now be running at http://localhost:5000.

2. Frontend Application

The frontend is a React application created with Create React App.

Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Install dependencies:

pnpm install      # or npm install

Start the dev server:

pnpm start        # or npm start

The application will open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Additional Notes for Forkers

MongoDB: Either install locally or use Atlas. Make sure MONGO_URI in .env points to the right DB.

YouTube API: Required for tutorial tracking; add YOUTUBE_API_KEY in .env.

Ports: Backend defaults to 5000, frontend defaults to 3000.
